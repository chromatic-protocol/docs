# Remove Liquidity

## Overview

This documentation will guide you through the process of removing liquidity and retrieving the LP receipt for liquidity provision in the Chromatic-Protocol SDK. These features allow users to contribute liquidity to markets in the Chromatic Protocol and obtain the liquidity provider receipt for their transactions.

## Remove Liquidity

To add liquidity to a market, use the `removeLiquidity` method of the `ChromaticRouter` instance:

- feeRate : The fee rate of Bin to provide liquidity.
- clbTokenAmount : The amount of clb token to add.

```typescript
await client
  .router()
  .removeLiquidity(marketAddress, { feeRate: 100, clbTokenAmount: ethers.utils.parseEther('10') });
```

To remove liquidity to multiple Bins at once, you can use the `removeLiquidities` method of the `ChromaticRouter` instance:

```typescript
await client.router().removeLiquidities(marketAddress, [
  { feeRate: 100, clbTokenAmount: ethers.utils.parseEther('5') },
  { feeRate: 200, clbTokenAmount: ethers.utils.parseEther('5') }
]);
```

The `removeLiquidity` method is asynchronous and returns a Promise, so you need to use `await` to wait for the removing liquidity process to complete.

## Retrieving Receipt

Once the transaction is completed, you can retrieve the associated account address using the `lpReceipts` method of `ChromaticLens`:

```typescript
const lpReceipts = await client.lens().lpReceipts(marketAddress);
```

The `lpReceipts` method is also asynchronous and returns a Promise that resolves to the receipt of `removeLiqudity`.
