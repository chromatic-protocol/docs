# Open Position

## Overview

This documentation will guide you through the process of opening a new position when trading on the Chromatic Protocol.

## Prerequisites

Before opening a position, ensure that you have completed the following steps:

- Set up the Chromatic Protocol SDK by following the installation instructions.
- Create an account using the SDK, as account creation is required before trading. Refer to the "Create an Account" section for more information.

## Opening a New Position

To open a new position on the Chromatic Protocol, use the `openPosition` method provided by the `ChromaticRouter` instance. This method allows you to specify the market address, leverage, taker margin, maker margin, and maximum allowable trading fee.

```typescript
import { Client } from "@chromatic-protocol/sdk-ethers-v5"

const client: Client = ... // Replace with your instantiated Client object

const marketAddress: string = ... // Replace with the address of the market you want to trade on
const leverage: number = ... // Specify the leverage for the position
const takerMargin: string = ... // Specify the taker margin amount
const makerMargin: string = ... // Specify the maker margin amount
const maxAllowableTradingFee: string = ... // Specify the maximum allowable trading fee

await client.router().openPosition(
  marketAddress,
  leverage,
  takerMargin,
  makerMargin,
  maxAllowableTradingFee
)
```

Replace the placeholders (`client`, `marketAddress`, `leverage`, `takerMargin`, `makerMargin`, `maxAllowableTradingFee`) with your actual values. Make sure you have the sufficient funds in your account to open the position.

The `openPosition` method is asynchronous and returns a Promise, so you need to use `await` to wait for the position opening process to complete.

## Retrieving Positions

After opening a position, you can retrieve information about your positions using the `getPositions` method provided by the `ChromaticPosition` instance. This method requires the market address and an array of position IDs.

```typescript
const positionIds = await client.account().getPositionIds(marketAddress)
const positions = await client.position().getPositions(marketAddress, positionIds)
```

The `getPositionIds` method retrieves the array of position IDs associated with the specified market address. Then, you can use the `getPositions` method to retrieve detailed information about each position.
