# Withdraw Liquidity

## Overview

This documentation will guide you through the process of remove liquidity and retrieving the liquidity in the Chromatic-Protocol SDK.

## Withdraw Liquidity

To withdraw liquidity to a market after adding liquidity and oracle price updated, use the `withdrawLiquidity` method of the `ChromaticRouter` instance:

```typescript
const marketAddress = '0x...';
const lpReceiptId = 1; // Receipt id of removeLiquidity
await client.router().withdrawLiquidity(marketAddress, lpReceiptId);
```

To withdraw liquidity to multiple receipts at once, you can use the `withdrawLiquidities` method of the `ChromaticRouter` instance:

```typescript
const marketAddress = '0x...';
const lpReceiptIds = [1, 2];
await client.router().withdrawLiquidities(marketAddress, lpReceiptIds);
```

The `withdrawLiquidity` method is asynchronous and returns a Promise, so you need to use `await` to wait for the withdraw liquidity process to complete.

## Retrieving Liquidity

Once the transaction is completed, you can retrieve your own liquidity using the `ownedLiquidityBins` method of `ChromaticLens`:

```typescript
const marketAddress = '0x...';
const signerAddress = '0x...';
const myBins = await client.lens().ownedLiquidityBins(marketAddress, signerAddress);
```

The `ownedLiquidityBins` method is also asynchronous and returns a Promise that resolves to the own liquidity.
