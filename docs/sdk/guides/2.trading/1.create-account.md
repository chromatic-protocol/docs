# Create an Account

## Overview

This documentation will guide you through the process of creating an account and retrieving the account address for trading.

## Prerequisites

Before opening a position, ensure that you have completed the following steps:

- Set up the Chromatic Protocol SDK by following the installation instructions.

## Creating an Account

Before you can start trading on the Chromatic Protocol, you need to create an account. The account creation process associates your Ethereum address with the SDK.

To create an account, use the `createAccount` method of the `ChromaticAccount` instance:

```typescript
import { Client } from "@chromatic-protocol/sdk-ethers-v5"

const client: Client = ... // Replace with your instantiated Client object

await client.account().createAccount();
```

The `createAccount` method is asynchronous and returns a Promise, so you need to use `await` to wait for the account creation process to complete.

## Retrieving the Account Address

Once the account is created, you can retrieve the associated account address using the `getAccount` method:

```typescript
const accountAddress = await client.account().getAccount();
```

The `getAccount` method is also asynchronous and returns a Promise that resolves to the Ethereum address of the account.
