# Provide Liquidity

## Introduction

The Chromatic Protocol allows users to provide liquidity to the protocol's liquidity pools. Providing liquidity is an essential aspect of the protocol as it ensures sufficient liquidity for perpetual futures trading. The liquidity provision process consists of two stages:

1. **Add Liquidity**: Users add liquidity to the Chromatic Protocol by depositing funds into a specific ChromaticMarket contract. This is done by calling the `addLiquidity` function of the ChromaticRouter contract. Users need to specify the target ChromaticMarket contract, the desired fee rate, the amount to be added as liquidity, and the recipient address. Before calling the `addLiquidity` function, users must approve the token to be deposited to the ChromaticRouter contract.

2. **Claim Liquidity**: After adding liquidity and receiving an LP receipt, users can claim their corresponding CLBToken from the ChromaticMarket contract. The CLBToken represents the user's accumulated liquidity. Users can claim liquidity by calling the `claimLiquidity` function of the ChromaticRouter contract. The function requires the target ChromaticMarket contract address and the receipt ID of the LP receipt.

## ChromaticRouter Interface

The `IChromaticRouter` interface is used to interact with the liquidity provision functionality of the Chromatic Protocol. It extends the `IChromaticLiquidityCallback` interface and provides the following functions:

### addLiquidity

The `addLiquidity` function allows users to add liquidity to a specific ChromaticMarket contract. It takes the target ChromaticMarket contract address, the fee rate, the liquidity amount, and the recipient address as input parameters. Users must approve the token to be deposited to the ChromaticRouter contract before calling this function. The function returns an LP receipt that represents the user's added liquidity.

### claimLiquidity

The `claimLiquidity` function enables users to claim their corresponding CLBToken from a specific ChromaticMarket contract. Users need to provide the target ChromaticMarket contract address and the receipt ID of the LP receipt they want to claim.

## LP Receipt Structure

The LPReceipt struct represents a receipt of an LP action performed. It contains the following properties:

- `id`: An identifier for the receipt.
- `oracleVersion`: The oracle version associated with the action.
- `amount`: The amount involved in the action.
- `recipient`: The address of the recipient of the action.
- `action`: An enumeration representing the type of LP action performed.
- `tradingFeeRate`: The trading fee rate associated with the LP action.

## Example Usage

Here is an example that demonstrates how to use the ChromaticRouter interface to add liquidity and claim liquidity:

```solidity
// Import the required interfaces
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC20.sol";
import "@chromatic-protocol/contracts/periphery/interfaces/IChromaticRouter.sol";
import "@chromatic-protocol/contracts/core/interfaces/IChromaticMarket.sol";

// Instantiate ChromaticRouter contract
IChromaticRouter router = IChromaticRouter(/* router address */);

// Define liquidity parameters
address market = /* market address */;  
int16 feeRate = /* fee rate */;         
uint256 amount = /* liquidity amount */; 
address recipient = /* recipient address */; 

// Approve tokens for deposit
IERC20 token = IERC20(IChromaticMarket(market).settlementToken());
token.approve(address(router), amount);

// Add liquidity
LpReceipt memory receipt = router.addLiquidity(market, feeRate, amount, recipient);

// After the oracle version has elapsed

// Claim liquidity
router.claimLiquidity(market, receipt.id);
```

In this example, we first instantiate the ChromaticRouter contract. Then, we define the liquidity parameters such as the target ChromaticMarket contract, the fee rate, the liquidity amount, and the recipient address. Before calling the `addLiquidity` function, users should approve the token to be deposited to the ChromaticRouter contract. We then invoke the `addLiquidity` function to add liquidity to the ChromaticMarket contract, which returns an LP receipt. Finally, we use the `claimLiquidity` function to claim the corresponding CLBToken for the added liquidity.
