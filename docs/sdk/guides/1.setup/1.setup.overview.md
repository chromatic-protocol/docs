# Setup

## Overview

This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up the SDK.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using the Chromatic Protocol SDK, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- An Arbitrum Ethereum provider or a local Arbitrum Ethereum node
- An Ethereum wallet or signer (such as MetaMask) with a funded account on the Arbitrum chain


## Installation

To install the Chromatic Protocol SDK, run the following command in your project directory:

```shell
npm install @chromatic-protocol/sdk-ethers-v5
```

or

```bash
yarn add @chromatic-protocol/sdk-ethers-v5
```

## Setting up the Client

To interact with the Chromatic Protocol, you need to create a `Client` instance. The `Client` class acts as the entry point for accessing various functionalities provided by the SDK. It requires a signer or provider object.

Here's an example of setting up the `Client`:

```typescript
import { Signer } from 'ethers';
import { Client } from "@chromatic-protocol/sdk-ethers-v5"

const chain: string = "arbitrum"; // Specify "arbitrum" as the chain name for the Arbitrum chain
const signer: Signer = ...; // Replace with your Ethereum signer or wallet instance
const client: Client = new Client(chain, signer);
```

Replace "arbitrum" with the name of the Arbitrum chain you want to connect to.

Make sure to replace ... with your actual Ethereum signer or wallet instance.
