# Use Flashloan

## Introduction
The Flash Loan feature in Chromatic Protocol allows users to borrow a specific amount of tokens within a single transaction. This feature provides temporary access to a large amount of liquidity without requiring the borrower to provide collateral. The Flash Loan feature is implemented through the `ILendingPool` interface, which serves as the interface for the lending pool contract. To handle the flash loan callbacks, the contract implementing the flash loan functionality must also implement the `IChromaticFlashLoanCallback` interface.

## Interface: IChromaticFlashLoanCallback
The `IChromaticFlashLoanCallback` interface defines the function signature for handling flash loan callbacks in the Chromatic Protocol.

### Functions
The `IChromaticFlashLoanCallback` interface provides the following function:

#### `flashLoanCallback(uint256 fee, bytes calldata data) external`
Handles the flash loan callback after a flash loan has been executed.

- `fee`: The fee amount charged for the flash loan.
- `data`: Additional data associated with the flash loan, which is passed when calling the `flashLoan` function in the `ILendingPool` interface.

### Example Usage
To utilize the Flash Loan feature and handle the flash loan callback, a contract must implement both the `ILendingPool` interface for executing flash loans and the `IChromaticFlashLoanCallback` interface for handling the callback. Here's an example:

```solidity
// Import the required interfaces
import "@chromatic-protocol/contracts/core/interfaces/vault/ILendingPool.sol";
import "@chromatic-protocol/contracts/core/interfaces/callback/IChromaticFlashLoanCallback.sol";

contract FlashLoanExample is IChromaticFlashLoanCallback {
    ILendingPool lendingPool;

    constructor(address _lendingPoolAddress) {
        lendingPool = ILendingPool(_lendingPoolAddress);
    }

    function executeFlashLoan(address token, uint256 amount, address recipient, bytes calldata data) external {
        // Perform necessary operations before the flash loan

        // Execute the flash loan
        lendingPool.flashLoan(token, amount, recipient, data);

        // Perform necessary operations after the flash loan
    }

    function flashLoanCallback(uint256 fee, bytes calldata data) external override {
        // Handle the flash loan callback

        // Access and utilize the `data` parameter for additional processing
        // ...

        // Perform necessary operations after the flash loan has been executed
    }
}
```

Make sure to implement the logic for handling the flash loan callback in the `flashLoanCallback` function of your contract and use the `data` parameter to retrieve any additional information passed during the flash loan execution.

## Conclusion
The Flash Loan feature in Chromatic Protocol provides users with a powerful tool to access liquidity without the need for collateral. By utilizing the `ILendingPool` interface to execute flash loans and implementing the `IChromaticFlashLoanCallback` interface to handle the flash loan callbacks, developers can incorporate flash loan functionality into their applications and create innovative use cases within the Chromatic Protocol ecosystem.
